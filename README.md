# PySparkYT
HW assignment: Group project - Using a web scraper and data from 3 months of top 100 trending YouTube videos, we created a model to attempt to identify how long a trending video would trend for. I would like to emphasize that all of the model building and feature engineering was completed by me in this project, my partners scraped the data and loaded it into a PySpark RDD and cleaned it, as well as some of the exploratory analysis/ paragraphs seen in the paper.

intended to show systematic thinking/ process while building a large model in pyspark testing random forest models, linear models, using various selection criteria to manage data.
